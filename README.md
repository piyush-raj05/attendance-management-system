# Attendance-Management-System
Online Attendance management system deals with the maintenance of the student’s attendance details. It generates the attendance of the student on the basis of presence in class. It is maintained on a daily basis of all particular class of their attendance. Every single staff will be provided with a separate Email &amp; password to make the respective class's student’s status also more then one class is provided to take Attendance.

<h3> PROBLEM DEFINITION </h3>
​
This system developed will reduce the manual work and avoid
redundant data. Bymaintainingtheattendance manually,thenefficientreports cannot be generated. The system can generate efficient weekly,consolidate
report based on the attendance. As the attendances are maintained in registers it
has been a tough task for admin and staff to maintain for long time. Instead the
software can keep long and retrieve the information when needed.
​
<h3> PROJECT OVERVIEW </h3>
This Attendance Management System basically has two main modules
for proper functioning :- Admin module is has rights for updating, modifing any class of
faculty for student details. Faculty has a rights of making daily attendance, generating
report. Attendance report can be taken by given details of student details, date,
class.
​
<h3> MODULE DESCRIPTION </h3>
​
The system should be designed in such a way that only authorized
people should be allowed to access some particular modules. The records
should be modified by only Faculty and no one else. The user should always
be in control of the application and not the vice versa. The user interface should
be consistent so that the user can handle the application with ease and speed. The
application should be visually, conceptually clear.
